Strider Mobile assessment - 2.0

## Getting Started

This project is related to a Strider Mobile assessment

- Author: Fernando Bela Ferracini

## Overview

Posterr is a new social media application. Posterr is very similar to Twitter, but it has far fewer features.
Posterr only has two screens, the home (default), and the user profile screen.

## The functions implemented so far are:

### Home Screen:
- On the Home screen we have a feed with all posts from all users displayed in descending order of posting date (from newest to oldest).
- On this screen it is also possible for the active user to make new posts, reposts and posts with comments.

### User Profile screen:
- In the User Profile screen it is possible to see the data of the active user: display name, username and joined date in Posterr.
- This screen displays counters with the number of posts, reposts and quote reposts made by the user.
- This screen displays a personalized feed with only the posts, reposts and quote reposts made by the active user.
- On this screen it is also possible for the active user to make new posts, reposts and posts with comments.
- On this screen it is possible to change the active user by selecting one of the 4 preloaded users (@fernandoferracini, @lukesky, @leiaorgana, @solo).

### General business rules implemented:
- Users are not allowed to post more than 5 posts in one day (including reposts and quote posts)
- Posts can have a maximum of 777 characters
- When writing a post, a user should see how many characters she/he has left
- Users cannot update or delete their posts.
